Tool to publish board-status data to the website
================================================

This tool parses the board-status repository (and the coreboot repository as
companion) to build a meaningful representation of the test coverage stored
in board-status.

The server runs these regularly to update
https://coreboot.org/status/board-status.html

How to use
----------
When modifying the tool, or when publishing the results elsewhere, you
might want to run it yourself. You'll need the board-status and the coreboot
repository checked out.

To build the tool, run the following commands

    $ go mod download
    $ go build

To run it, use

    $ ./board-status.html \
      -board-status-dir .../board-status.git \
      -coreboot-dir .../coreboot.git > out.html

There will be a few errors about missing revisions, those come from status
reports based on unpublished commits.

LIMITATIONS
-----------
The tool doesn't support board variants or "clone of" specifiers in
board-info.txt. The output is also a bit unwieldy, leading to many megabytes
of HTML in a single file.

/*
 * tpm_setup starts the TPM and establishes the root of trust for the
 * anti-rollback mechanism.  SetupTPM can fail for three reasons.  1 A bug. 2 a
 * TPM hardware failure. 3 An unexpected TPM state due to some attack.  In
 * general we cannot easily distinguish the kind of failure, so our strategy is
 * to reboot in recovery mode in all cases.  The recovery mode calls SetupTPM
 * again, which executes (almost) the same sequence of operations.  There is a
 * good chance that, if recovery mode was entered because of a TPM failure, the
 * failure will repeat itself.  (In general this is impossible to guarantee
 * because we have no way of creating the exact TPM initial state at the
 * previous boot.)  In recovery mode, we ignore the failure and continue, thus
 * giving the recovery kernel a chance to fix things (that's why we don't set
 * bGlobalLock).  The choice is between a knowingly insecure device and a
 * bricked device.
 *
 * As a side note, observe that we go through considerable hoops to avoid using
 * the STCLEAR permissions for the index spaces.  We do this to avoid writing
 * to the TPM flashram at every reboot or wake-up, because of concerns about
 * the durability of the NVRAM.

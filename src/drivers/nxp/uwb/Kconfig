	  Enable support for a NXP UWB SR1xx (e.g., SR150) chip.

	  A configuration should be added to device tree like below:
	  device ref gspi0 on
	          chip drivers/nxp/uwb
	                  # The ACPI name of the device.  Note it will be
	                  # truncated to 4 characters if a longer name is given.
	                  register "name" = ""UWB0""

	                  # Description of the module.
	                  register "desc" = ""NXP UWB Module""

	                  # SPI bus speed (in Hz).
	                  register "speed" = "1000000"

	                  # The GPIO connected to SENSORINT.
	                  register "irq_gpio" = "ACPI_GPIO_IRQ_LEVEL_HIGH(GPP_F21)"

	                  # The GPIO connected to CHIP_EN.
	                  register "ce_gpio" = "ACPI_GPIO_OUTPUT_ACTIVE_HIGH(GPP_A12)"

	                  # The GPIO connected to WAKEUP.
	                  register "ri_gpio" = "ACPI_GPIO_OUTPUT_ACTIVE_HIGH(GPP_A7)"

	                  device spi 0 on end
	          end

	   This driver is for Fibocom FM350-GL PCIe 5G WWAN.
	   When enabled, this driver will add support for ACPI controlled
	   WWAN using GPIOs for power/reset control of the device.
	   This driver depends on rtd3 driver code to build as it needs to
	   point to the rtd3 chip on the same parent for the methods provided
	   only for the same root port.

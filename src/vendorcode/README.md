The files in the coreboot src/vendorcode subdirectory are supplied by
various hardware and software vendors to support their platforms.  While
these directories and files are a part of the coreboot project, their
licenses, coding styles, and maintenance may be significantly different
than the rest of the coreboot codebase.

By contributing these directories and files to the coreboot codebase,
the authors and copyright holders have agreed to the use and
modification of these files by the coreboot community, however the final
ownership and responsibility still remains with the company that
contributed the files.

The ideal goal would be to properly integrate these files into coreboot
proper. But such undertakings should be coordinated with the owners.
Community modification should in general be limited to fixing issues and
adding functionality.

Licenses for the files were determined by the copyright holder when the
files were contributed.  All files here must have an open source license
compatible with coreboot's GPL v2.

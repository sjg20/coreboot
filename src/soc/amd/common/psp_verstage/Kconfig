config PSP_VERSTAGE_CCP_DMA
	bool
	default n
	help
	  Configure PSP Verstage to use Crypto Co-processor (CCP) DMA while
	  accessing the boot device. Select it on platforms which supports
	  using CCP DMA to access the boot device.

config PSP_S0I3_RESUME_VERSTAGE
	bool "S0i3 resume verstage"
	depends on VBOOT_STARTS_BEFORE_BOOTBLOCK
	default n
	help
	  Select this item to enable running verstage during S0i3 resume.

config PSP_INIT_TPM_ON_S0I3_RESUME
	bool
	depends on TPM2 && PSP_S0I3_RESUME_VERSTAGE
	default PSP_S0I3_RESUME_VERSTAGE
	help
	  If the TPM is reset while in S0i3, it must be reinitialized
	  during s0i3 resume. This must be performed in PSP verstage since
	  coreboot is otherwise not involved with s0i3 resume.

config PSP_SUPPORTS_EFS2_RELATIVE_ADDR
	bool
	default n
	help
	  On SoCs where PSP uses A/B recovery layout, PSP support relative addressing
	  from the start of the SPI ROM. Enable this config on SoCs where PSP supports
	  relative addressing so that PSP verstage can pass the offset.

config SEPARATE_SIGNED_PSPFW
	def_bool n
	help
	  Put signed AMD/PSP firmwares outside FW_MAIN_[AB] so vboot doesn't verify them,
	  and rely on PSP's verification.

config SOC_AMD_COMMON_BLOCK_CAR
	bool
	default n
	help
	  This option allows the SOC to use a standard AMD cache-as-ram (CAR)
	  implementation.  CAR setup is built into bootblock and teardown is
	  in postcar.  The teardown procedure does not preserve the stack so
	  it may not be appropriate for a romstage implementation without
	  additional consideration.  If this option is not used, the SOC must
	  implement these functions separately.
	  This is only used for AMD CPU before family 17h. From family 17h on
	  the RAM is already initialized by the PSP before the x86 cores are
	  released from reset.

config SOC_AMD_COMMON_BLOCK_NONCAR
	bool
	default n
	help
	  From family 17h on AMD CPUs/APUs don't use cache as RAM (CAR) any
	  more, since the RAM initialization is already done by the PSP when
	  the x86 cores are released from reset.

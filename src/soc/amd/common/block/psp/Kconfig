config SOC_AMD_COMMON_BLOCK_PSP
	bool
	help
	  This option builds in the Platform Security Processor initialization
	  functions. Do not select this directly in SoC code, select
	  SOC_AMD_COMMON_BLOCK_PSP_GENx instead.

config SOC_AMD_COMMON_BLOCK_PSP_GEN1
	bool
	select SOC_AMD_COMMON_BLOCK_PSP
	help
	  Used by the PSP in AMD systems before family 17h, e.g. stoneyridge.

config SOC_AMD_COMMON_BLOCK_PSP_GEN2
	bool
	select SOC_AMD_COMMON_BLOCK_PSP
	select SOC_AMD_COMMON_BLOCK_SMN
	help
	  Used by the PSP in AMD family 17h, 19h and possibly newer CPUs.

config SOC_AMD_PSP_SELECTABLE_SMU_FW
	bool
	help
	  Some PSP implementations allow storing SMU firmware into cbfs and
	  calling the PSP to load the blobs at the proper time.

	  The soc/<codename> should select this if its PSP supports the feature
	  and each mainboard can choose to select an appropriate fanless or
	  fanned set of blobs.  Ask your AMD representative whether your APU
	  is considered fanless.

config AMD_SOC_SEPARATE_EFS_SECTION
	bool
	help
	  Use separate EFS FMAP section instead of putting EFS into CBFS. The
	  FMAP section must begin exactly at the location the EFS needs to be
	  placed in the flash. This option can be used to place the EFS right
	  after the 128kByte EC firmware at the beginning of the flash.

config SOC_AMD_COMMON_BLOCK_PSP_FUSE_SPL
	bool
	default n
	depends on SOC_AMD_COMMON_BLOCK_PSP_GEN2
	help
	  Enable sending of set SPL message to PSP. Enable this option if the platform
	  will require SPL fusing to be performed by PSP.

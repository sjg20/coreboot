config SOC_INTEL_INTEGRATED_SOUTHCLUSTER
	bool
	help
	  Apollo Lake and Gemini Lake are single-chip platforms with a south
	  cluster instead of a PCH. Most of the IP blocks are the same as in
	  PCH platforms, but there are several differences that need to be
	  accounted for.

config SOC_INTEL_COMMON_PCH_CLIENT
	bool
	select SOC_INTEL_COMMON_PCH_BASE
	help
	  Selected by "Client" platforms, i.e. desktops, workstations,
	  laptops, tablets... This also includes uniprocessor servers
	  based on the same silicon as desktops and workstations. The
	  "Client" platforms include additional IP blocks that are of
	  little to no use on servers.

config SOC_INTEL_COMMON_PCH_SERVER
	bool
	select SOC_INTEL_COMMON_PCH_BASE
	help
	  Selected by "Server" platforms, i.e. multi-socket capable
	  platforms used in large servers and workstations, such as
	  those using the Lewisburg (C620) PCH.

config SOC_INTEL_COMMON_PCH_BASE
	bool
	depends on SOC_INTEL_COMMON_BLOCK
	help
	  This option is meant to be selected by the specific options above.

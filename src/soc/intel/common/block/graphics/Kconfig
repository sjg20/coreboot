	  PCI config offset 0x18 point to LMEMBAR and need to add GTT size to
	  reach at DSM which is referred here as SOC_INTEL_GFX_MEMBASE_OFFSET.
	  SoC that follow such design would override SOC_INTEL_GFX_FRAMEBUFFER_OFFSET
	  with GTT_SIZE value. On SoC platform where PCI config offset 0x18 points
	  to the GMADR directly can use the default value 0x0 without any override.

	  Intel common block support for assigning PCI IRQs dynamically. This
	  allows coreboot to control the IRQ assignments. They are passed to the
	  FSP via UPD, and also exposed to the OS in ACPI tables. The SoC must
	  provide a list of IRQ programming constraints; this module will avoid
	  IRQs that are used by GPIOs routed to IOAPIC.

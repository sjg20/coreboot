	  Add a WAD file to be loaded by coreDOOM.

	  A WAD file contains all the game data for the Doom-engine, and
	  is required to play the game.

	  A list of the WAD files included in the official games can be
	  found here: https://doomwiki.org/wiki/IWAD
	  These WADs can be extracted from copies of the game that you
	  own, and the shareware WADs may be freely downloaded from the
	  internet.

	  For a completely free (as in freedom) experience, the Freedoom
	  project (https://freedoom.github.io) provides original game
	  content under the BSD license. Other WADs not mentioned here are
	  also available and may be found from various sources such as
	  the internet and copies of other games using the Doom engine.

# Supermicro X11SSH-TF

This section details how to run coreboot on the [Supermicro X11SSH-TF].

## Required proprietary blobs

* [Intel FSP2.0]
* Intel ME

## Flashing coreboot

The board can be flashed externally using *some* programmers.
The CH341 was found working, while Dediprog won't detect the chip.

For more details have a look at the [flashing tutorial].

The flash IC can be found between the two PCIe slots near the southbridge:

## BMC (IPMI)

This board has an ASPEED [AST2400], which has BMC functionality. The
BMC firmware resides in a 32 MiB SOIC-16 chip in the corner of the
mainboard near the [AST2400]. This chip is an [MX25L25635F].

## Known issues

- Intel SGX causes secondary APs to crash (disabled for now).
- Tianocore doesn't work with Aspeed NGI, as it's text mode only.
- SMBus / I2C does not work (interrupt timeout)

## Tested and working

- USB ports
- M.2 2280 NVMe slot
- 2x 10GB Ethernet
- SATA
- RS232
- VGA on Aspeed
- Super I/O initialisation
- ECC DRAM detection
- PCIe slots
- TPM on TPM expansion header
- BMC (IPMI)

# Conferences
The coreboot community is present at a number of conferences over the year,
usually at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org), [OSFC](https://osfc.io), and the
[Chaos Communication Congress](https://events.ccc.de/congress/).

The kind of presence differs, but there's usually a booth or other kind of
gathering where everybody is welcome to say hello and to learn more about
coreboot.

Depending on the nature of the conference, coreboot developers might bring
their development kit with them and conduct development sessions.

Upcoming release - coreboot 4.17
================================

The 4.17 release is planned for May, 2022.

We are continuing the quarterly release cadence in order to enable others to
release quarterly on a fresher version of coreboot.

Update this document with changes that should be in the release notes.

* Please use Markdown.
* See the past few release notes for the general format.
* The chip and board additions and removals will be updated right
  before the release, so those do not need to be added.

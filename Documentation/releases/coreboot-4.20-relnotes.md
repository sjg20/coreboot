Plans to move platform support to a branch
------------------------------------------

### Intel Quark SoC & Galileo mainboard

The SoC Intel Quark is unmaintained and different efforts to revive it
have so far failed.  The only user of this SoC ever was the Galileo
board.

Thus, to reduce the maintanence overhead for the community, support for
the following components will be removed from the master branch and will
be maintained on the release 4.20 branch.

  * Intel Quark SoC
  * Intel Galileo mainboard

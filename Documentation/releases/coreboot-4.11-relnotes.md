Upcoming release - coreboot 4.11
================================

The 4.11 release is planned for October 2019

Update this document with changes that should be in the release
notes.
* Please use Markdown.
* See the [4.9](coreboot-4.9-relnotes.md) and [4.10](coreboot-4.10-relnotes.md)
  release notes for the general format.
* The chip and board additions and removals will be updated right
  before the release, so those do not need to be added.

Clean Up
--------
Because there was only a single developer board (AMD Torpedo)
using AGESA family 12h, and because there were multiple,
unique Coverity issues with it, the associated vendorcode will
be removed shortly after this release.

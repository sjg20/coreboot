Upcoming release - coreboot 4.10
===========================

The 4.10 release is planned for April/May 2019

Update this document with changes that should be in the release
notes.
* Please use Markdown.
* See the [4.7](coreboot-4.7-relnotes.md) and [4.9](coreboot-4.9-relnotes.md)
 release notes for the general format.
* The chip and board additions and removals will be updated right
before the release, so those do not need to be added.

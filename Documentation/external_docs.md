# External Resources

This is a list of resources that could be useful to coreboot developers.
These are not endorsed or officially recommended by the coreboot project,
but simply listed here in the hopes that someone will find something
useful.

Please add any helpful or informational links and sections as you see fit.

## OpenSecurityTraining2

OpenSecurityTraining2 is dedicated to sharing training material for any topic
related to computer security, including coreboot.

There are various ways to learn firmware, some are more efficient than others,
depending on the people. Before going straight to practice and experimenting
with hardware, it can be beneficial to learn the basics of computing. OST2
focuses on conveying computer architecture and security information in the form
of structured instructor-led classes, available to everyone for free.

All material is licensed [CC BY-SA 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/),
allowing anyone to use the material however they see fit, so long as they share
modified works back to the community.

Below is a list of currently available courses that can help understand the
inner workings of coreboot and other firmware-related topics:

* [coreboot design principles and boot process](https://ost2.fyi/Arch4031)
* [x86-64 Assembly](https://ost2.fyi/Arch1001)
* [x86-64 OS Internals](https://ost2.fyi/Arch2001)
* [x86-64 Intel Firmware Attack & Defense](https://ost2.fyi/Arch4001)

There are [additional security courses](https://p.ost2.fyi/courses) at the site
as well (such as
[how to avoid writing exploitable code in C/C++](https://ost2.fyi/Vulns1001).)

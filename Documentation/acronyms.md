  context from memory, and jump back to the operating system to pick up
  where it left off.
* S4 - ACPI System Power State: Suspend to Disk.  The processor context
  and all the contents of memory are copied to the hard drive. This is
  typically fully handled by the operating system, so resume is a normal

  contents of memory.  Any critical processor state is restored.
